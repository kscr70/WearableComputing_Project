Once download the file was unzipped and the folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" was placed in my working directory.

This script requires that there be a directory (or folder) labeled "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory.

The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder must include the following folders and files:

1. folder labeled `train` with the files:
 *`subject_train.txt`
 *`X_train.txt`
 *`y_train.txt`
2. folder labeled `test` with the files:
 *`subject_test.txt`
 *`X_test.txt`
 *`y_test.txt`
3. And these files directly in the "UCI HAR Dataset folder":
 *`activity_labels.txt`
 *`features.txt`
